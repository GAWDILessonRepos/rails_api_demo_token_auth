# Rails Token Auth Example

This will establish an API for user [token authenication](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1592534/what-is-token-based-authentication) via JSON. This is significantly different than *cookie* authentication and is the preferred solution. You will have to write the JavaScript end yourself.

Code *very heavily* borrowed and inspired by [TangoSource's repo](https://github.com/tangosource/rails-api-token-authentication)
